# Music Database Insights

In this project, I built SQL queries and subqueries on a music storeâ€™s relational database to identify targeted insights based on business requirements and report on them with technical analysis and visualizations. This results in the delivery of actionable conclusions using business acumen and accurate data manipulation in SQL.

## Questions to Investigate:

- How many customers and how much in sales does each sales rep bring in?
- What is the most common media type for all music files?
- What are the sales and number of customers by state in the USA?
- What is the most popular genre for each state in the USA?
- What is the most popular artist for each state in the USA?

## Workflow Setup

Download the [chinook.db](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) locally. I performed my queries in SQLite, but you can use SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or DB2 as well.
